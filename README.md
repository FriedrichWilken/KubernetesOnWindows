# KubernetesOnWindows
## How to run
Finally, no more need for a makefile:
```
vagrant up
```
will set up everything.

IMPORTANT: do not log into the VMs until the provisioning is done. That is especially true for Windows because it will prevent the reboots.

In case you still have an old instance of these VMs running for the same dir:
```
vagrant destroy -f && vagrant up
```
I have only tested this on one machine so if you run into trouble creating new issues (with info about your system) are very welcome. 

## Where did I steal all the stuff?
This guide is based on [this very nice Vagrantfile](https://gist.github.com/danielepolencic/ef4ddb763fd9a18bf2f1eaaa2e337544) and this very good [guide on how install Kubernetes on Ubuntu Focal (20.04)](https://github.com/mialeevs/kubernetes_installation). 
For the Windows part is used this [guide on how to install Docker on Win Server 2019](https://www.hostafrica.co.za/blog/new-technologies/how-to-install-docker-on-linux-and-windows/#win))  and another [this](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/adding-windows-nodes/) [~~this~~](https://www.hostafrica.co.za/blog/new-technologies/install-kubernetes-cluster-windows-server-worker-nodes/) guide on how to install Kubernetes on Win Server 2019 .
