# Welcome to the sig-windows Development Environment !

This is a fully batteries-included development for Windows on Kubernetes, including:
- Vagrant file for launching a two-node cluster
- the latest containerd
- NetworkPolicy support for Windows and Linux provided by [Antrea](https://antrea.io)
- Windows binaries for kube-proxy.exe and kubelet.exe that are fully built from source (K8s main branch)
- kubeadm installation that can put the bleeding edge linux control plane in place, so you can test new featuers like priveliged containers
 
# Goal

Our goal is to make Windows ridiculously easy to contribute to, play with, and learn about for anyone interested
in using or contributing to the ongoing Kubernetes-on-Windows story. Windows is rapidly becoming an increasingly
viable alternative to Linux thanks to the recent introduction of Windows HostProcess containers and Windows support for NetworkPolicies + Containerd integration.

## Prerequisites

- vagrant
- vagrant reload plugin
- some vagrant provider (we only have virtualbox automated here, but these recipes have been used with others, like HyperV and Fusion).

# Lets run it!

Ok let's get started... 

## 1) Pre-Flight checks...

For the happy path, just:

0) Start docker so that you can build k8s from source as needed.
1) Install vagrant, and then vagrant-reload
```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload
```
2) Modify cpu/memory in the variables.yml file.  We recommend 4 cores 8G+ for your windows node if you can spare it, and 2 cores 8G for your linux node as well. 
 
## 2) Run it!

There are two use cases for these Windows K8s dev environments: Quick testing, and testing K8s from source.

## 3) Testing from source? make all

To test from source, run `vagrant destroy --force ; make all`.  This will
- destroy your existing dev environment 
- clone down K8s from GitHub. If you have the k/k repo locally, you can `make path=path_to_k/k all` 
- compile the K8s proxy and kubelet
- inject them into the Vagrant Windows environment at the C:/k/bin/ location 
- start up the Linux and Windows VMs
- ... TODO ~ build Linux components from source as well ...

### Quick testing: Vagrant up

```
# 1) First run this, bc Vagrant needs to do some reload of machines
vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload 

# 2) Bring up your entire Windows cluster! 
vagrant up
```

AND THAT'S IT! Your machines should come up in a few minutes...

## IMPORTANT
Do not log into the VMs until the provisioning is done. That is especially true for Windows because it will prevent the reboots.

## Other notes 

If you still have an old instance of these VMs running for the same dir:
```
vagrant destroy -f && vagrant up
```
after everything is done (can take 10 min+), ssh' into the Linux VM:
```
vagrant ssh master
```
and get an overview of the nodes:
```
kubectl get nodes
```
The win node might stay 'NotReady' for a while, because it takes some time to download the flannel image.
```
vagrant@master:~$ kubectl get nodes
NAME     STATUS     ROLES                  AGE    VERSION
master   Ready      control-plane,master   8m4s   v1.20.4
winw1    NotReady   <none>                 64s    v1.20.4
```
...
```
NAME     STATUS   ROLES                  AGE     VERSION
master   Ready    control-plane,master   16m     v1.20.4
winw1    Ready    <none>                 9m11s   v1.20.4
```

I have only tested this on one machine. If you run into trouble, you're very welcome to create a new issue and include info about your system. 

## Accessing the Windows box

You'll obviously want to run commands on the Windows box. You can do this by noting the IP address during `vagrant provision` and running *any* RDP client (vagrant/vagrant for username/password).

To run a *command* on the Windows boxes without actually using the UI, you can use `winrm`, which is integrated into Vagrant. For example, you can run:

```
vagrant winrm winw1 --shell=powershell --command="ls"
```

## Where we derived these recipes from 

- This guide is based on [this very nice Vagrantfile](https://gist.github.com/danielepolencic/ef4ddb763fd9a18bf2f1eaaa2e337544)
- this very good [guide on how to install Kubernetes on Ubuntu Focal (20.04)](https://github.com/mialeevs/kubernetes_installation). 
- The Windows part is informed by this [guide on how to install Docker on Win Server 2019](https://www.hostafrica.co.za/blog/new-technologies/how-to-install-docker-on-linux-and-windows/#win), [this guide on adding Windows nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/adding-windows-nodes/), and [this guide](https://www.hostafrica.co.za/blog/new-technologies/install-kubernetes-cluster-windows-server-worker-nodes/) on how to install Kubernetes on Win Server 2019.
- We've also borrowed ideas from cluster api, kubeadm, and the antrea project too bootstrap how we manage CNI and containerd support.
